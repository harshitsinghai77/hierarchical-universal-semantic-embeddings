# hierarchical-universal-semantic-embeddings
HUSE learns cross-modal representation with semantic information. HUSE learns a shared latent space where the distance between any two universal embeddings is similar to the distance between their corresponding class embeddings in the semantic embedding space. HUSE also uses a classification objective with a shared classification layer to make sure that the image and text embeddings are in the same shared latent space.
